# Résumé de Léonard

This is my Résumé generator. You can check out my Résumé [here](https://leonard.sh/resume.pdf).

## How it works?

- The data is hosted by [Gist](https://gist.github.com/leonardssh/d72297eb48abfad33e70e1313cd35614) with [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) standard.
- The website is hosted by [Netlify](http://netlify.com/) with CI/CD.
- PDF is generated with [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/).

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** I did a lot hacks to make it suitable for my design, which may not be good to be general used as a template.
